# theEngine
A simple DirectX 3D game engine!

***************************************************************************************************
This engine is nothing special, it is actually pretty horrible right now and should not really
be classified as a game engine. It is in a very early stage of developement with pretty much
no functionality as an engine, however the source code could be recycled into another project
as a base to a graphics engine of a game.
