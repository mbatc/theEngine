# theEngine
A simple DirectX 3D game engine!

***************************************************************************************************
This engine is nothing special, it is actually pretty horrible right now and should not really
be classified as a game engine. It is in a very early stage of developement with pretty much
no functionality as an engine, however the source code could be recycled into another project
as a base to a graphics engine of a game.
***************************************************************************************************

This engine is being written primarily in C++ and uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) as a base for the GUI in the engine (This being the reason that the exe and solution name is 'MFCEngine'). The graphics API is DirectX9 so not the most recent, but it is the most frequentl used in tutorials on the never ending internets.

theEngine is primarily a educational project for myself. I am hoping that while learning how to write a lot of the neccessary code to make a functional game engine, i will learn a lot more about C++ and also how it(C++) and DirectX interact with the hardware. So far whilst writing the engine, i have learned a lot more about this stuff (as of the 9th update in the wiki) and there is a lot more 'engine' to be written and i am exited about the challenges i will have to tackle in the future. The only annoying thing is that i am trying to fit in time to work on the program inbetween school and work. This doesnt leave much time so updates may stop coming for a while when assignments start popping up, but i will never forget...

To see recent update logs (sort of) goto the the wiki!
