# theEngine
A simple DirectX 3D game engine!

This engine is being written primarily in C++ and uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) as a base for the GUI for the engine.


Update 1:

So far there nothing but a few basic dialog panels to change object properties. However these do not do anything yet as i am in the process of porting all the graphics and main engine functionality(of which there is not much) from another project. The reason for this is that i had previously been using Win32 but decided to go with MFC.
